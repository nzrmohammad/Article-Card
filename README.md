# Pagination System for Card Display

This project implements a pagination system for displaying cards in a web application. It allows users to navigate through multiple pages of cards, with a customizable number of cards displayed per page.

## Features

- **Pagination**: Navigate through pages of cards with intuitive pagination links.
- **Customizable**: Easily adjust the number of cards displayed per page according to your needs.
- **Responsive**: The pagination system is designed to work seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Include the `pagination.js` script in your HTML file.
3. Ensure that you have a container with the class `pagination` in your HTML, where the pagination links will be appended.
4. Update your HTML structure to include cards with the class `card` that you want to paginate.

    ```html
    <div class="pagination"></div>
    <div class="card">Card 1</div>
    <div class="card">Card 2</div>
    <!-- Add more cards as needed``` -->

Usage
Set the number of cards you want to display per page by adjusting the cardsPerPage variable in the pagination.js file.
Open your HTML file in a web browser, and you'll see the pagination links at the bottom.
Click on the pagination links to navigate through different pages of cards.
